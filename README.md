##  Overview

**Assure-Fi** is an AI-powered security platform designed to protect users from common threats in the DeFi ecosystem such as scam tokens, rug pulls, and malicious smart contracts.

With Sei's growing ecosystem, the need for intelligent and real-time security tools is more critical than ever. Assure-Fi fills that gap by providing transparency, trust scores, and scam detection â€” all in one platform.

- Detecting **rug pulls** and liquidity exit scams  
- Flagging **unsafe or unaudited** smart contracts  
- Offering **trust signals** for newly launched tokens  
- Centralizing scam alerts from Telegram, Discord, and Twitter
